# PyTorch-playground
Playground repository containing PyTorch models and various ML concepts.

Each file contains different operation on the MNIST dataset. There are two NN - deep "linear" network and CNN. At the end they are both tested with my own handwritten digits.
Next two files contains Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) which I used for reconstructing destructed digits or creating new ones.
