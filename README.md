# PyTorch-playground
Playground repository containing PyTorch models and various ML concepts.

Each file except Neural Transfer contains different operation on the MNIST dataset. There are two NN - deep "linear" network and CNN. At the end they are both tested with my own handwritten digits.
Next two files contains Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) which I used for reconstructing destructed digits or creating new ones.  

Neural_Transfer.ipynb is a modified version of this [PyTorch Tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/neural_style_tutorial.html) and it is based on [A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style, Gatys et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576).
